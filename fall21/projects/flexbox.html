          <p>The flexbox is one method we can use to start to create dynamic (flexible) layouts, grids, and compositions on our web pages. A flexbox has two basic parts: the flex container and flex items. We can turn any element into a flex container by giving it the property:</p>
<xmp>display:flex;</xmp>
<br>
          <p>Any elements contained within this element (its children) will be considered flex items. Flex items can also be given <em>display:flex;</em> and will become flex containers themselves, allowing us to nest dynamic containers within dynamic containers.</p>
          <p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll be focusing on the flex container and we'll be referencing this guide:</p>
          <div class="btn-wrap row">
            <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks,<br>Flexbox Guide</a>
          </div>

          <hr>

          <p>After having gone through that guide, let's practice some more by working on one of the following two options:</p>

          <h1>Option 1</h1>
          <p>Recreate this image using flexbox:</p>
          <img style="max-width:1000px; width:100%;" src="../img/flex-practice.png">
          <p>Before beginning, assess the compostion and try to determine how many flex containers we will need and what direction each should be working in (as a tip: we will need at least one large flex container for all of our other containers). Here's a working example that you can inspect if you get lost or stuck:
          <div class="btn-wrap row">
            <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="../in-class-sites/flex-practice/index.html">Working Example</a>
          </div><br>

          <h1>Option 2</p>
          <p>Make a small website sketch implementing flexbox in some way. Maybe it's a composition or maybe it's some imagined future interface — it can be as simple or complex as you want. (If you need some more structure: imagine a landscape and then try to draw that landscape with just rectangles, circles, and color — organized with flexbox of course.)</p>
          <p>Here's some examples of what I mean by "small sketch":</p>
          <div class="btn-wrap row">
            <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="../archive/flexbox/index.html">Hourglass<br>(try resizing)</a>
            <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="../archive/flexbox2/index.html">Waterfall<br></a>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <p>And finally, for more flexbox practice there is a small educational game called flexbox froggy :-) I recommend going through it once!</p>
