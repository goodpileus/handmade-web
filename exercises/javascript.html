    <h3>Javascript Intro</h3>
    
    <p>Now that we understand the fundamentals of the web, we can start venturing into the weeds of javascript...</p>
    <p>This excercise will focus on copy/pasting code from sources and tweaking it to get it to behave the way we want it to.</p>

    <p>To start, it might help to define some of the things we'll be dealing with:</p>

    <h3><em>Functions</em></h3>
    <p>"Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value." In this example we'll be writing a simple function that contains a series of tasks that we want it to execute every time that function is called.
    <br>
    More on functions at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions">mdn docs</a>.</p>

    <h3><em>Variables</em></h3>
    <p>Variables, written as 'var', 'let', or 'const', are "containers for storing data." In this example we'll be using a variable to create a shorthand way of referencing a longer string of text (in this case a 'method') that will be used to select an element in our HTML.
    <br>
    More on variables at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">mdn docs</a>.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Events</em></h3>
    <p>An event is something that "the browser does, or something a user does." Events are happening all the time in the background as the user interacts with the webpage and we can use javascript to react to those events. In this example, we'll be using the 'onclick' event to trigger our function. As the name suggests, this event will be triggered when the user clicks on a specified element.

    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now, let’s make a button that toggles a class on a specific div.</p>
    <p>The HTML:</p>
<xmp><!-- first we set up the button that is triggering our javascript -->
<!-- note that the element doesn't need to be a <button> to work -->
<button onclick="FUNCTION">Click me...</button>

<!-- this is the element that we will be altering with our javascript -->
<div id="menu" class="box">
  the box
</div>
</xmp>

    <p>The CSS:</p>

<xmp>.active {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: slategray;
  color: white;
  font-size: 20px;
}
</xmp>

    <p>The Javascript we’ll place at the bottom of our body, inside script tags:</p>

<xmp><script>
<!-- this is the function we want to call when the button is clicked -->
function FUNCTION-NAME() {
  <!-- first we set up a variable to store a longer line of code in case we want to reference it quickly later -->
  <!-- here, we're creating a shorthand way of targeting a specific element with an id by using javascript's getElementById method -->
  var VARIABLE = document.getElementById("ID");

  <!-- in this line we use javascript's built-in classList property and toggle method to toggle a class on and off -->
  VARIABLE.classList.toggle("NEW-CLASS");
}
</script>
</xmp>
  <p>
    Now all that remains to be done is to go through and replace the ALL-CAPS words in the code with our own identifiers.
  </p>

  </div>
</section>

<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/js.cookie.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/functions.js"></script>

<!-- opens relevant sidebar dropdown -->
<script>
  setTimeout(function() {
    $("#nav-exercises").attr("open", "open");
  }, 500);
</script>

</body>
</html>
