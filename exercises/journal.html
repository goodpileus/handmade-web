    <h3>Journal</h3>
    <p>For some assigned readings I will ask you to respond to the reading with a short journal entry that you will upload to your class site. A few sentences is all that is required, but feel free to write and add however much you would like &mdash; this is your space after all!</p>
    <p>There will be some time for reading discussions, but class time will largely be reserved for work, review, and activities. However, these readings will help facilitate a common understanding about the history and present context of the web. Ideally, they will also serve as inspiration for you (as they have for me).</p>
