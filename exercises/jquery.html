    <h3>jQuery and Libraries</h3>

    <p>Next, let’s borrow code from elsewhere and practice using different libraries and plugins with Javascript. As an example, let's try to add a marquee to our site.</p>

    <p>A quick search for “javascript marquee” brought me here: <a href="https://github.com/aamirafridi/jQuery.Marquee" target="_blank">jQuery.marquee</a>.</p>

    <p>You'll often come across free to use and open-source plugins/code in spaces like github. The clarity and usefulness of the documentation will vary — but over time and with practice, parsing and understanding how to implement found code will only get faster and easier over time.</p>

    <p>Before we jump into following the setup instructions on the github page, we'll need to prepare our document a bit.</p>

    <p>Since this script was written using jQuery we’ll need to link the jQuery library to our website. A library is a collection of functions, operations, and other bits of code that expand on or extend the use of a given programming language. jQuery is a widely used javascript library that defines itself as “a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.” Essentially, it simplifies javascript programming by reducing the length of standard javascript syntax and packaging commonly used functions into shorter, easy to use methods.
    <br>
    You can read more on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp">w3schools jQuery intro</a></p>

    <p>First, we'll need to download the latest “compressed production build” from <a href="https://jquery.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Copy the jQuery .js file into your website folder.</p>
    <p>Next, we’ll create a link to it in our html document. We’ll place it at the bottom of the body:</p>
<xmp><script src="path-to-js/jquery.js"></script>
</xmp>

    <p>Next, create a new file and name it something like “functions.js”. This will be the .js file where we will add our own functions to.</p>

    <p>Create a link to it in the same way that we linked the “jquery.js” file, but make sure it is below the jQuery reference link. The order here is important as the javascript that we will be writing in our “functions.js” file will be dependent on the jquery library above it — and as we know by now, the HTML document is being read from the top to the bottom.</p>

<xmp><script src="path-to-js/functions.js"></script>
</xmp>

    <p>Now, we’ll just follow the install instructions on <a href="https://github.com/aamirafridi/jQuery.Marquee" target="_blank">jQuery.marquee</a> to set everything up!</p>
