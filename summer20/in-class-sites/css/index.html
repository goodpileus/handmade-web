      <p class="orange">The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, <a href="https://google.com" class="special">a link!</a> and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to <span class="special">learn and make on the web</span>, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid</span> the subject. This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the <span class="special">best practices</span>, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space. <a href="https://google.com">a link!</a></p>
