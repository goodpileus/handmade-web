    <h3>Screensaver</h3>
    <p>Screensavers are now antiquated pieces of software that were originally designed to prevent CRT screen burn-in. Modern screens don’t have this problem anymore, but screensavers remain (though increasingly less common) as a relic of early home computing. The screensaver was a moment for the computer to rest and to dream in its own way, without the control of the user.</p>
    <p>What might the “use” of a screensaver be today? How might the screensaver challenge the way that we use and think about technology/websites?</p>
    <p>Make a website that functions as a screensaver using css animation (or other forms of movement if you want to experiment). As you work on the site, reflect on the role of waiting, idleness, interludes, uselessness, or lack of control in the context of digital media.</p>
