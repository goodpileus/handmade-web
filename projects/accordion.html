    <h3>Accordion</h3>
    <p class="due">due: 10/10</p>

    <p>While making websites, you will find yourself frequently resizing your browser window, dragging from the sides and the corners to test and visualize how the site looks at different screen or window sizes. Most websites don't consider this behavior a useful way of engaging with a website, and most users won't think to see what happens when the window is resized -- but that doesn't mean we can't experiment with it (and maybe we can even change some minds...).</p>

    <p>Create a website that uses media queries to construct a narrative across different screen sizes (or a browser that is being operated like an accordion).</p>

    <p>Consider how a website might change when being viewed on a phone and not the desktop. How might the story it is telling change or adapt? Is the space the same or is it something entirely different?</p>
      
    <p>Also consider how you might communicate that the visitor should resize the window. Will you signify explicitly or with subtlety? Do you even need to?</p>
