    <h3>Final</h3>
    <p class="due">due: 4/30</p>
    <p>The final project can be whatever you would like. There are no guidelines except that it should be personal. This is your moment to add a brick to the digital village, a flower to the online garden, a droplet of water in the cloud. Consider all the websites you’ve looked at and visited. Which ones offer the kind of space you’re interested in making? What kind of space would you like to add to the corridors of the web? What feels missing? Consider starting a project that you will continue to work on/maintain into the future. As they say: “the web is always under construction”…</p>
    <p>Consider the amount of time you’ll have to work on this (about 5 weeks) when planning the scope of this project.</p>
    <p>Some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A project you’ve had in mind for some time</li>
      <li>A collection of sketches or smaller websites</li>
      <li>An extension of your practice</li>
      <li>A piece of a project from outside class</li>
      <li>An elaboration on a project that we’ve worked on in class already</li>
      <li>Anything else...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the project you have in mind is larger than what we have time for in class, don’t worry! It’s totally okay to use this project as a way to prototype, test, and experiment for a much larger project. You can use this time to set up a solid foundation for the site and establish goals and plans for the future. I’m here to help facilitate and plan no matter what you decide to do!</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Time</li>
      <li>Care</li>
      <li>Experimentation</li>
      <li>Doesn’t need to be “large” but should be solid in concept and craft</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cannot be made using Cargo, Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, or any other website builder. If you’re interested in using a CMS, consider using something like Kirby or Wordpress -- any themes/templates must be of your own construction.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="hr-blank">

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider buying and attaching a unique domain name to your site. How might a domain name benefit or alter the experience of the site?</li>
      <li>Are you designing a site that privaleges viewing on the desktop, the phone, or considers both equally?</li>
      <li>Who do you expect to visit this website?</li>
      <li>How can the website be found? Does it connect to the physical world?</li>
      <li>How might the site grow, change, adapt in the future?</li>
    </ul>
